high prio
- TODO0001 implement blitters and related functions
- TODO0004 Make it 64bit clean
- TODO0005 Make it endian agnostic

med prio
- TODO0003 Implement sound streaming
- HACK000A Clean up system specific hacks, especially wrt. wchar_t
- HACK000C Workaround for code trying to access non-existent buttons
- TODO000B Some values in MovementNoise() can wrap and then produce incorrect results
- TODO000C MakeSureMedKitIsInHand() is severly broken: Big items can end up in small slots. Checking for first aid kits is probably not necessary at all
- TODO000D In PickRandomPassengerFromVehicle() using MercPtrs[ubChosenMerc] is probably wrong (should choose from the ubChosenMerc found mercs, not from the first ubChosenMerc mercs)
- TODO000E In SayBattleSoundFromAnyBodyInSector() using MercPtrs[ubChosenMerc] is probably wrong (should choose from the ubChosenMerc found mercs, not from the first ubChosenMerc mercs)

low prio
- TODO0000 remove RestrictMouseCursor() et al.
- HACK0001 put the process properly to sleep during idle phases instead of SDL_Delay(1)
- HACK0002 get rid of the directory mumbo jumbo
- HACK0007 Stop PreRandom always returning 0 or 1 without ensuring an equal
  distribution, which would be a rather complex task with pregenerated randoms
- HACK0009 Workaround for trying to play samples with an empty ("") name. Investigate why this happens
- HACK000B Remove unused fields which are only kept for savegame compatibility
- TODO0006 The IMP personality quiz evaluation seems to have some bugs
- TODO0007 Deduct AIM_PENALTY_SMG when firing a SMG even when second hand is free?
- TODO0008 The random call here seems to be off-by-one. If it returns its maximum value then no assignment to iAttitude happens, because the next loop tries to find the n+1th peak of n peaks.
- TODO0009 Possible endless loop
- TODO000A Memory leak?
