HACK000D
TODO0016

high prio
- TODO0001 implement blitters and related functions
- TODO0004 Make it 64bit clean
- TODO0005 Make it endian agnostic
- HACK000D SDL_BlitSurface() sometimes returns with the direction flag set on x86, which violates the ABI.  Remove the "cld" hack once SDL is fixed.

med prio
- TODO0003 Implement sound streaming
- HACK000A Clean up system specific hacks, especially wrt. wchar_t
- HACK000C Workaround for code trying to access non-existent buttons
- TODO000B Some values in MovementNoise() can wrap and then produce incorrect results
- TODO000F Only half of the data gets saved/loaded
- TODO0011 gubAnimCrawlSpeeds[] is only declared, gubAnimCrawlingSpeeds[] is never referenced, looks like a typo

low prio
- TODO0000 remove RestrictMouseCursor() et al.
- HACK0001 put the process properly to sleep during idle phases instead of SDL_Delay(1)
- HACK0007 Stop PreRandom always returning 0 or 1 without ensuring an equal
  distribution, which would be a rather complex task with pregenerated randoms
- HACK0009 Workaround for trying to play samples with an empty ("") name. Investigate why this happens
- HACK000B Remove unused fields which are only kept for savegame compatibility
- TODO0006 The IMP personality quiz evaluation seems to have some bugs
- TODO0007 Deduct AIM_PENALTY_SMG when firing a SMG even when second hand is free?
- TODO0008 The random call here seems to be off-by-one. If it returns its maximum value then no assignment to iAttitude happens, because the next loop tries to find the n+1th peak of n peaks.
- TODO0009 Possible endless loop
- TODO000A Memory leak?
- TODO0012 Is this fix for the infinite loop when throwing right?
- TODO0013 Code and comment disagree
- TODO0014 Properly resolve the bReverse mess
- TODO0015 Inconsistency between AddStructToTailCommon() and AddStructToHead() regarding return value of FindStructure()
- TODO0016 r and b are swapped
