v0.8 - 2008-02-20 - Lemon
* Add support for Maemo, so the menu button acts as modifier key to perform right clicks.
* (Partially) fix a vanilla bug: Mercs could perform actions while looking into the opposite direction, when they were moving backwards just before.  In most cases this was harmless, but in some instances (climbing down a roof, jumping over a fence) the merc would end up in the wrong spot.
* Minor improvement of the English translation.

* Fix a bug in the sound system: Some sounds are sampled at 44kHz, but the sound system uses 22kHz as playback rate, so resample these sounds before playing.
* Fix a crash, which is caused by a vanilla mixup of SoldierID and ProfileID, in the insurance contract screen when there are no insurable mercs.
* Improve the German translation, especially fix gross vanilla mistranslations for the terms "shooting range" and "hired".

* Fix a vanilla glitch: When looking at the description of an item in tactical mode, the status of the item was erroneously highlighted, too, when the item has low weight (only the weight should be highlighted).
* Fix two vanilla bugs: The test, whether there are two free slots to recruit John and Mary, was never triggered, so when only one slot was left, it resulted in a crash.  Further the test was too restrictive and checked for three free slots instead of two.
* Fix a vanilla bug which could lead to missing light effects in tactical when loading savegames.
* Fix a vanilla out of bounds array access in CalcChanceToHitGun().
* Fix a vanilla bug: The Russian versions did not play NPC speeches, because they incorrectly used different filenames than all other languages, but the filenames in the data files are the same.
* Improve Russian translation, especially fix one gross vanilla mistranslation, which mixed up Carmen and Slay.
* Fix a vanilla glitch: Do not show a balance in the personnel screen when looking at past mercs.
* Fix vanilla display bug: No path was plotted and no APs for walking were calculated for refueling when the cursor was on a vehicle.

* Correct the char to glyph translation table. This should fix the Polish translation.
* Simplify the interface of GetTileIndexFromTypeSubIndex(). This also fixes one vanilla incorrect use of this function in PasteSingleBrokenWall().

v0.4 - 2007-07-08 - Cherry
* Add configfile handling and change the code to use the configfile to determine the path to the binary data.
* Fix a vanilla bug: In SwapLarrysProfiles() ->bInvStatus[] gets copied twice, but ->bInvNumber[] not at all. Rectify this.
* Fix a vanilla glitch: If text is highlighted and delete gets pressed do not just beep but actually delete the text.
* Slightly alter the behaviour when pressing left and right without shift and a part of the text was highlighted, i.e. do not consider the fact there was a highlight when calculating the new cursor position. It feels better this way imo.
* Fix hotkey highlights in texts
* Load the item names from the correct position in the data file.
* Fix a vanilla resource leak: Unload all fonts on exit. Five fonts were not unloaded.
* Check whether gusSelectedSoldier is not NO_SOLDIER before using it as an index into MercPtrs[] to prevent an out of bounds array access. This fixes a crash when entering tactical mode in a sector where all mercs are busy.
* Fix a vanilla memory leak in ClearEventQueue(): Free the removed events.
* #include <stdint.h> to get the declaration for uintptr_t and do not rely on namespace pollution of other headers.
* Fix wide string/string format specifiers.
* Fix two vanilla bugs in the IMP result mail generator:
  - No text was generated if agility was below average, but above the extremly low limit, because the latter test was reversed
  - If leadership was the only extremly low attribute no introduction text was generated
* Do not store the email subjects in the savegames, but always fetch them from the data files. This way f.e. you do not end up with english subjects when loading a savegame made with the english version in the german version.
* Just use *.jsd as pattern instead of *.[Jj][Ss][Dd]. The former works on Windows' FindFirstFile() and should work on case sensitive filesystems too, because all filenames are required to be lowercase. This fixes the problem of missing corpses on Windows.
* Use given parameter Length instead of lengthof(sString). This fixes the sector a merc is in not being displayed in the strategic screen.

v0.3 - 2007-04-08 - Chocolate
* Windows support
* The yes/no buttons for deleting emails work again now.
* Simplify the code to swap emails. This fixes the vanilla bug that sorting emails corrupts emails with variable content (i.e. mercenary names and monetary amounts), because not all parts of emails got swapped.
* Plug some vanilla file leaks on error.
* Slightly improve command line parameter parsing and provide the -nosound switch.
* Fix a vanilla bug: If FileOpen() fails 0 is returned, not -1.
* Fix incorrect vanilla resource handling: In CreateVideoObject() the passed HIMAGE gets destroyed on only one error path, not on others and neither if the function returns successfully. Its callers always destroy the HIMAGE, therefore remove the only DestroyImage() in CreateVideoObject(), so the HIMAGE does not get freed twice on this error path.
* Fix a vanilla glitch: In BltStretchVideoSurface() return with an error, if either VSurface has a colour depth != 16, not only if both have a colour depth != 16.
* Fix a vanilla resource leak: Do not leak a lock on a VSurface on error.
* Fix incorrect vanilla file handling: Do not leak the file handle when playing a Smack file fails.
* Fix incorrect vanilla file handling: Do not close the file in STCILoadIndexed(). The caller does that.
* Fix incorrect vanilla file handling: When reading a savegame fails do no close the file multiple times.
* Fix incorrect vanilla file handling: When writing a savegame fails do no close the not yet opened file resp. do not close it multiple times.
* Remove a vanilla restriction: There is no technical reason to forbid % and \ when entering text. % caused problems because printf()-like functions were used incorrectly. \ never was a problem.
* Use the unicode char provided by SDL for text input. This is a lot simpler and avoids the internal translation table, which cannot respect different keyboard layouts.
* Use scroll lock to toggle input grabbing. This is useful for scrolling with the mouse in tactical mode when playing in windowed mode.
* Fix wide string/string format specifiers.

v0.2 - 2007-03-15 - Pistachio
* Fix scrolling of the tactical view: SDL_UpdateRect() was missing.
* Implement sound support.
* Fix some vanilla format string vulnerabilities which lead to crashes when a text field (for example the savegame title) contains a percent sign.
* Fix vanilla odditities in string handling: Properly print percent ("%") signs.  Some strings get parsed by printf()-like functions multiple times. Of course only the first time (if at all) they should be interpreted as format strings. Therefore Do The Right Thing(tm) and use "%S" as format string and the already parsed string as argument in the subsequent runs. The directly visible effect is dissapearing percent signs. There are some gross (and partially incorrect, because they had a dangling % in the format string) workarounds for this in the code. Now that these strings are correctly handled remove those workarounds.
* Fix wide string/string format specifiers.
* Do not try to close a file when it was not opened.
* Use %C instead of %c to print wchar_ts.
* Set the title bar text to something meaningful.
* Fix a vanilla incorrect translation, which also displayed some garbage.
* Implement Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferOutlineZPixelateObscuredClip().
* Implement Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferTransShadowZNBClip().
* Implement Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferOutlineZClip().
* INTERFACE/mapcursr.sti gets loaded thrice in direct succession and leaked twice.
* Remove video objects which only get loaded and deleted (if at all, memory leak, anyone?), but never used.
* Implement Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferOutlineClip() and Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferShadowZNBClip(). They are used when things get thrown + clipping.
* Implement a simple zoom blitter.
* Implement Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferOutlineZNB() and Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferShadowZNB(). They are used when things get thrown.
* Fix a vanilla out of bounds access: The money button image has 5 subimages, not 7, which is assumed for creating this button in the tactical screen. Use the same subimages like the map screen.
* Implement Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferTransZTranslucent() and Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferTransZNBClipTranslucent(). They are used for explosions and probably other semi-transparent stuff.
* Fix minor graphical glitch in Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferTransZClipPixelateObscured(): The pixelation alignment was dependent on the number of skipped lines, which it should not.
* Fix Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferTransShadowZNBObscuredClip(): The obscured parts of the sprites were not displayed.
* Implement Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferTransZClipPixelateObscured().
* Fix a memory leak: The SDL_Surface got leaked when deleting a video surface.
* Fix a vanilla memory leak which happens during loading savegames.
* Fix Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferMonoShadowClip(), clipping was done incorrectly which lead to graphical artifacts when drawing text.

* Implement a hack to display /something/ when a zooming blit is requested.
* Make the editor compile and start. You need the file "Editor.slf".

* Implement Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferTransZ().
* Implement Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferTransZPixelateObscured().
* Place a SDL_Delay(1) in the main loop so the process doesn't eat that much CPU
* Implement Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferOutline() and Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferOutlineShadow().
* Repaired Random() (original Implementation broke with RAND_MAX > 32767).
* Fix wide string/string format specifiers.
